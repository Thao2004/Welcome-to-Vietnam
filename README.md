#  WELCOME TO VIETNAM - WWDC23 SWIFT STUDENT CHALLENGE (ACCEPTED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose¬†of this playground is to present people from all over the world to Vietnam, from its breathtaking landscapes to its delectable traditional cuisines. 


# INTRODUCE MYSELF
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, everyone üòÑ !!! I'm Thao Nguyen, and I'm from Vietnam. I am a freshman at the University of South Florida studying Computer Science.  I just started learning coding üíª this year. Yes, it is hard but at the same time I find it really interesting. I can't wait to learn more¬†and participate in the tech field. I want¬†to create a variety of enjoyable and useful projects for everyone to enjoy. 


# THE STORY BEHIND THIS PLAYGROUND
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     There are many reasons that inspire me to create this project. Since 2019, I have been an international student in the United States. I arrived here as a high school student; I am the school's only Vietnamese student. My American friends have never met a Vietnamese person or experienced Vietnamese culture before; therefore, they are quite interested in learning about my country. They were always curious in the famous landscapes and amazing food in Vietnam. It's difficult to imagine with simply what I've described; since then, I've been thinking of methods to introduce people to Vietnam and show them my beautiful nation. Then I learned about the challenge, I instantly thought of ways to design something to bring people to learn about Vietnam. Thanks to this challenge, I have learned new skills and built this cool playground at the same time. 

     Another reason is that since starting college, I've met a lot of Vietnamese people who were born in the United States. They don't know much about Vietnam and say they wish to learn more about their origins. They would like to travel there some day. The project not only introduces people to my country, but it also dispels myths and misconceptions about Vietnam. Many individuals believed that Vietnam was unsafe, impoverished, and underdeveloped.

      I hope that after they explored my playground, they will have a better understanding of Vietnam and will come to visit someday!!!



#For best experience, I reccommend choosing iPad Air (5th generation) simulator to explore my playground.
